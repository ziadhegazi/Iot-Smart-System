The files in here are what can be used to test few things while working on the project.

i2c_scanner:
	- Used to detect any module or sensor connected that uses the i2c protocol.
ina219_current_sensor:
	- the basic code for the INA219 sensor that outputs current, voltage, and power.
slave_device:
	- What I used for the final execution of the project, which includes all the sensors.
	- It communicates with the Master device (RPI or PC) to send the readings from sensors.
	- Controls the fans and their speed.
temp_pir_ldr:
	- Basic code to test out my temperature, PIR, and LDR sensors.
