In here You can find the initial Raw data used before being processed and cleaned as well as ML code used to analyse the data.
Smart Building (Folder):
	- It consists of 51 folders, numbered, one for each room.
	- Each room folder has 5 files, one for each sensor used.
smartbuilding.ipynb:
	- This is the code used for the data preprocessing and model creation.
	- It contains data visualisation process to show how the data looks before and after cleaning.
smartbuilding(Tidy).ipynb:
	- It is the same as the previous file. However, its looks Tidier.
	- It uses the cleaned data version straight away without going through the data cleaning and manipulation first.
	- No data visualisation.
testdata.csv:
	- Raw data combined together.
smart_building_cleaned.csv:
	- Cleaned data.
pretrained_model.py:
	- testing pre trained models.
trained_adaboost_model.pkl:
	- Pretrained model.
